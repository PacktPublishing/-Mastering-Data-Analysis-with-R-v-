## About the Video Course
With its popularity as a statistical programming language rapidly increasing with each passing day, R is increasingly becoming the preferred tool of choice for data analysts and data scientists who want to make sense of large amounts of data as quickly as possible. R has a rich set of libraries that can be used for basic as well as advanced data analysis tasks. If you have a basic understanding of data analysis concepts and want to take your skills to the next level, this video is for you. Spanning over four hours, it contains carefully selected advanced data analysis concepts such as: cluster analysis; time-series analysis; Association mining; PCA (Principal Component Analysis); handling missing data; sentiment analysis; spatial data analysis with R and QGIS; advanced data visualization with R and ggplot2.

Throughout the video, readers will use the various topics they've learned about to analyze real-world datasets from various industry sectors. By the end of the tutorial, readers will have a thorough understanding of advanced data analysis concepts and how to implement them in R.
